 This is a simplified example for
 the User Rating feature in React.
 Keep in mind that this is a basic
 demonstration and may require
 modification and integration with
 other parts of your project.

Step 1:

Set up a new React project using
your preferred build tools
(e.g., Create React App).

Step 2:

Design the layout and component
structure of the app, including
the movie list, movie details,
and user rating components.

Step 3:

Fetch movie data from an API 
(e.g., IMDb API, The Movie Database API)
using HTTP requests or a library
like Axios. Store the fetched data
in the app's state.

Step 4:

Create a MovieList component that
receives the movie data as props 
and renders the list of movies.
Each movie item should include
a rating component.

Step 5:

Create a MovieDetails component
that receives a selected movie as
props and displays its details,
including the current rating.

Step 6:

Create a UserRating component that
displays a rating scale 
(e.g., 1-5 stars or a numerical scale)
and allows the user to rate the movie.
This component should maintain its own
state to track the selected rating.

Step 7:

Add an event handler in the UserRating
component to capture the user's rating
selection and update the component's
state accordingly.

Step 8:

Pass the selected rating from the
UserRating component to the MovieDetails
component as a prop.

Step 9:

In the MovieDetails component,
display the current rating received as a prop.

Step 10:

Implement functionality in the MovieDetails
component to update the rating when the
user submits a new rating. This may
involve making an API call to update
the rating on the server and updating
the app's state with the new rating.

Step 11:

Add logic to conditionally display the
UserRating component only if the user
is authenticated. You can use a user
authentication library or create your
own authentication system.

Step 12:

Create a user authentication component
that allows users to log in or create
an account. This component should manage
the user's authentication state and 
provide it to other components as needed.

Step 13:

Pass the user's authentication state
to the UserRating component, allowing 
it to determine whether to display
the rating scale.

Step 14:

Update the UserRating component to
handle cases where the user has already
rated the movie. In such cases, display
the user's previous rating and disable
further rating changes.

Step 15:

Implement the logic to store the
user's rating in a database or API,
associating it with the movie and
user's account.

Step 16:

Fetch the user's rating from the
API when the MovieDetails component
mounts and update the current
rating accordingly.

Step 17:

Test the app thoroughly, ensuring
that the user rating functionality
works as expected, and fix any bugs
or issues that arise.

Step 18:

Optimize the performance of the app,
such as by implementing memoization
techniques or lazy loading.
